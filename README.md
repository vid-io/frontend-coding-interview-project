# frontend-coding-interview-project

Welcome to vidIQ's frontend coding interview project! 🧑‍💻

During your interview, you will be asked to share your screen, so please clone this repo and get it running locally. We will focus on implementing a few features together and discussing the solutions you choose. You may use any tools and libraries you prefer and we encourage you to use your AI assistant of choice. 🤖

Note that you will be required to implement one feature by hand, so make sure you understand the fundamentals of React components and state management.

## Getting started

Install Node and pnpm on your machine.

```bash
# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Serve the app
pnpm dev
```
